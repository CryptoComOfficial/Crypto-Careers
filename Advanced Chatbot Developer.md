# Advanced Chatbot Development

We are seeking a highly skilled Generative AI and LLM (Large Language Model) developer to join our software development team. 

You will play a key role in developing and integrating an advanced, virtual human chatbot for one of our high-profile crypto clients. 

The chatbot will be similar to the cutting-edge technology seen on *https://www.digitalhumans.com*, aiming to deliver a highly interactive, human-like conversational experience

## Project Overview:

Our client’s crypto website requires an AI-powered virtual assistant that can:

*   Interact naturally with users through text and voice.
    
*   Provide accurate, real-time responses based on complex data.
    
*   Integrate with crypto-related services securely and efficiently.
    

This role starts with the integration of the chatbot into the website, followed by continuous enhancements to improve its intelligence, responsiveness, and user engagement.

## Key Responsibilities:

1.  Chatbot Integration (Initial Phase):
    

*   Deploy and integrate the existing AI chatbot into the client’s crypto platform.
    
*   Ensure smooth performance, data security, and compatibility with web technologies.
    

2.  Advanced Development (Ongoing):
    

*   Enhance Response Accuracy: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to improve how the chatbot fetches and generates relevant responses.
    
*   Vector Database Integration: Utilize tools like Pinecone to manage and search large datasets efficiently.
    
*   LLM Optimization: Integrate and fine-tune OpenAI GPT-4o to ensure high-quality, context-aware conversations.
    
*   Voice & Visual Features: Improve ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), TTS (Text-to-Speech), and LipSync to create realistic, human-like interactions.
    

## Required Skills:

*   Strong expertise in Generative AI, LLMs, and chatbot architecture.
    
*   Experience with OpenAI APIs, RAG techniques, and vector databases like Pinecone.
    
*   Proficiency in ASR-TTS-LipSync technologies.
    
*   Solid background in integrating AI systems with websites or web applications.
    
*   Familiarity with crypto platforms is a  more  plus.
    

## Compensation:

*   Hourly Rate: $70–$90 USDT (paid in cryptocurrency).
    
*   Flexible working hours with remote collaboration.
    

## Project Timeline:

*   We expect the chatbot integration and enhancements to be completed within 10–15 months.
