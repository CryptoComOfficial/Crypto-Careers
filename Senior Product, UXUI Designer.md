# Senior Product, UI/UX Designer  (Earn, WebApp)

[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is looking for a Senior Product Designer to drive and lead design in our DeFi Wallet. You’ll play a pivotal role in designing, testing, and improving our product that enables customers to explore decentralized finance and apps. DeFi Wallet is uniquely positioned with deep connections to the Cronos chain, a centralized [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) app and Visa cards that allow unique product opportunities.

Each product designer at [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) works directly with product managers, engineers, and also acts as a partner with research. Together they own part of an app vertical, and ship solutions collaboratively with their teams.

## Key Responsibilities

*   Think of this role as more than just pushing pixels. We're looking for a design partner who sees every interface as a complex puzzle waiting to be elegantly solved. You'll be:
    
*   Dismantling complex financial product challenges, then reconstructing them into experiences so intuitive they seem almost invisible
    
*   Challenging existing design paradigms with insightful questions that reveal deeper user needs
    
*   Navigating the intricate landscape between traditional finance and emerging crypto platforms, translating complexity into clarity
    
*   Building design solutions that aren't just beautiful, but fundamentally change how users interact with financial technology
    
*   Bridge engineering precision, product vision, and user expectations
    

## Your intellectual toolkit goes beyond technical skills. You are:

*   A master of the strategic question - able to unpack complex problems through thoughtful, precise inquiry
    
*   Comfortable challenging assumptions, including your own
    
*   Skilled at creating alignment not through dictation, but through collaborative exploration
    
*   Driven by a genuine passion for solving meaningful problems, not just completing tasks
    
*   We're looking for someone who understands that great design is a conversation - with users, with teammates, with the evolving technological landscape.
    
*   Your portfolio doesn't just showcase designs. It tells a story of systematic problem-solving, of turning user friction into moments of unexpected delight.
